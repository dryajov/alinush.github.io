title: How to give (and make) a presentation
---

These are my notes from a quick workshop at Stony Brook University given by Professor
Michael Bender and Professor Rob Johnson in May 2012.

How to _make_ the presentation
------------------------------

### Prefix competitive

 - If you had one slide, make your presentation.
 - If you had two slides, extend your 1 slide presentation.
 - 1 slide -> 2 slides -> 3 slides.

### Quick outline

 - Explain your problem (most likely to do bad on).
 - Explain why your problem is important.
 - Why do existing solutions not solve the problem?
 - Explain your contribution (most likely to do bad on).
   - Make clear what you did.
   - Make clear what other people did.
 - Talk about your solution.
 - Put results pretty early on in the presentation.

### Tips

If you have a title and you don't know how to begin, begin by explaining your
title.

Put your work in context:

 - Explain how you fit in and how you differentiate yourself from the other work.
 - Cite related work.

**No more than 40 (or 20?) words per slide.**

Include pictures/examples.

If it's a 10 minute talk, you don't have time to explain how you solved the
problem, but more interesting than how you solved the problem:

 - What the problem is.
 - What are difficult examples.
 - What were the difficulties.
 - What is the intuition behind the problem/solution.

**Don't take information away.**

### The conclusion slide

 - Philosophy, morals, summarize.
 - What does this mean?
 - What should people take out of this?

How to _deliver_ a presentation
-------------------------------

Giving a good talk has a lot more to do with following rules than being
naturally gifted.

 - First, slides have to be very fast.
 - Memorize your first sentence(s).
   + Say it confidently.
   + Likely to be nervous, so it's good to be prepared in the beginning
   + Begin the talk quickly.
   + A student actually put the title slide about a third into the talk.

Hardest thing, most of you will fail on:

 - Conclude your slides (individually).
   + Each slide must be introduced and concluded.
   + Concluding slides is really relaxing, everyone will feel great when you do
     that.
   + Conclusion of your slide should be on the slide.
   + Know the conclusions for each slide.
   + Basically your "topic sentence" now becomes your ending concluding sentence
     (opposite to normal writing).
 - Pause after conclusions, let yourself and the audience breathe.
   + One reason you don't do this is because you're concerned about time, or
     you can't wait to move on to the next slide.
   + If you can't say in a single sentence: "Why is this slide here?" then it's
     a bad slide.

Stand next to the screen, point with your fingers, the screen is not made of
sulfuric acid.

 - Practice touching the screen, it's a beautiful thing :)

Refer to **everything** on the slides.

**Do not apologize, ever.**

Make jokes, smile.

 - Follow with something self-referential.
 - Maybe add some silly pictures (strawberry, hamsters). Use this with caution.
 - Smile while giving talk.
   + If you're not enjoying yourself, then everyone else will feel awkward.

Should you read your slide, or should you just summarize your slide?

 - Do not read your slides in a monotone.
 - People can only focus on one thing at a time: don't have a paragraph on the
   slide and say something different.
   + People will have to choose between you and the paragraph.

Make your talk self-contained, that's the easiest way to present.

 - If you find you're paraphrasing from the slides, then you have bad slides.

**Practice your talk out loud.**

**Explain your talk to someone.**

 - Goal is not to make a talk that makes you look smarter because it's so
   difficult to understand.
 - Make a talk that's simple, elegant, and people can understand.
 - How can you make people both understand what you did and understand that it
   was difficult?
   + Make it seem like what you really did was more complicated actually
   + How do you say something is complicated?
     - Personal stories.

**Don't:**

 - Be nervous. Okay in the beginning, but shake it off.
 - Stare down at the floor.
 - Keep your hand in your pocket(s). My personal preference, at least.
