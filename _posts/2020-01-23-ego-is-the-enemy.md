This is [Ryan Holiday's "Ego is the enemy"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847818) in bullet-point form.

These are the ideas I found interesting from the book, without the excellent stories used to back them.
For those, you'll have to [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847818).
I changed some of the excerpts from 2nd person to 1st person, so they resonate more.
I kept the same table of contents as in the book, except I changed some of the chapter titles.

 > It's in everyone's head.  
 > And they trust him,  
 > Because they think they are him.  
 >
 > It's beautiful man...   
 > You have to admire the opponent's elegance.
 >
 > _(Revolver, 2005)_

## Intro

 - A prescription: _humility_.
 - Return to the humility and work-ethic it took me to get here.
 - I might not ever be straight, but I can strive for _straighter_.
 - Think less of myself. 
    + Be less invested in the story I tell myself (or others) about my own specialness. 
    + Then, be liberated to do what I want to do.
 - **Definition (Ego):**
    + An excessive focus on glorious outcomes instead of the sweat-ridden work.
    + Being dangerously focused on myself:
       * How do I look? 
       * How much money will I make?
       * How high do I stack up in the "intellectual hierarchy?"
    + An unhealthy belief in my own importance.
    + Arrogance.
    + Self-centered ambition.
    + Need to be "better than", "more than", "recognized for," beyond any reasonable utility.
    + Sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.
    + "I am God's gift to humanity."

Be humble in your aspirations, gracious in your success and resilient in your failures.

## Aspire

### Too much talk

 - My weak, egotistical side says _"I want to get as much public credit and attention as I can for doing the least possible."_
 - I seem to think being silent is a sign of weakness.
    + That being ignored is tantamount to death (and for the ego this is true).
 - Talk depletes us.
    + Talking and doing fight for the same resources. 
    + The only relation between work and chatter is that one kills the other.
 - Goal visualisation is important, but our mind can start to confuse it with actual progress. 
 - That feeling that others out there, in public, enjoying the limelight, are somehow getting the better end of the deal.
    + They are not. 
    + They're too busy working to do anything else.

### "To do" rather than "to be"

 - Impressing people is utterly different from being impressive.
 - _"A man is worked upon by what he works on"_ said Frederik Douglass, who was a slave and saw the effect slavery had even on the slave owners themselves.
    + e.g., What you choose to do for money works on you.
 - **"To be" $$<$$ "to do".**
    + "To do" means your purpose has to be something larger than you (i.e., larger than just "to be").
       * This could mean to accomplish something, or to prove something to yourself.
 - If you go with "to do", things are suddenly simpler, but _harder_.
    + Simpler, because you can easily decide.
       - You know what you need to _do_, what is important to you.
       * The rest are distractions.
       * Or maybe they're for recognition (i.e., "to be" rather than "to do").
       * You do _not_ need to compromise, since you're always doing what you want and need to be doing.
    + Harder, because you must harshly and strictly judge opportunities.
       + Do they help you do what you set out to do?
       * Are you being selfish (i.e., operating in "to be" mode) or selfless (in "to do" mode)?

### Become a student

 - The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice.
    + It prevents us from getting any better.
 - Have a _mentor_, someone who is clearly better than you, to learn from. 
    + Keeps your ego in check.
 - Have an equal, to occasionally test yourself against.
 - Have someone lesser, to teach.

### Don't be passionate

 - **Definition (Bad passion)**:
    + Unbridled enthusiasm.
    + Burning, unquenchable desire to start or to achieve some _vague_, ambitious and distant goal.
    + Seemingly innocuous motivation.
    + Can tell you in great detail who they intend to become and what their success will be like.
 - We only hear of the passion of successful people. 
 - We forget that failures share the same trait.
 - Maybe passion is necessary but not sufficient.
 - Instead, _purpose_: passion with boundaries. 
    + It de-emphasizes the "I." 
    + It's pursuing something outside of yourself.
<!-- - _Realism:_ detachment and perspective. -->
<!-- TODO: what was this 'realism' about? -->

<!-- TODO: find better title -->
### The canvas strategy

 - Say little, do much.
 - Be lesser, do more.
 - _The canvas strategy:_ Help yourself by helping others. 
 - Working for others keeps your ego in check.

### Restrain yourself

 - Put aside your ego and your basic sense of fairness and rights as a human being.
 - It doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly. It degrades them.
 - You're not able to change the system until _after_ you've made it.

### Get out of your own head

 > A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts,   
 > So he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.
 >
 > _(Alan Watts)_

 - Petrified of growing up.
 - Desperately wanting to get away.
 - Addicted to watching movies, preferring an idealized version of life on the screen.
 - Self-obsessed and immature, the world is too much to bear for you, driving you away from human contact.
 - **Thinking/fantasizing about doing something (and enjoying the imaginary aftermath) versus actually doing it.**
 - This could be the attitude I've (involuntarily) cultivated for the past 10 years.
 - If you are not careful, station **KFKD** (K fucked) will play in your head 24 hours per day:
    + Out of the right speaker: 
        * Endless stream of self-aggrandizement, 
        * Recitation of one's specialness,
        * How much more open and brilliant and knowing and misunderstood and humble one is.
    + Out of the left speaker: 
        * Rap songs of self-loathing,
        * List of all things one doesn't do well,
        * All the mistakes made today and over one's lifetime,
        * The doubt,
        * The assertions...
            + That everything that one touches turns to shit,
            * That one doesn't do relationships well,
            * That one is in every way a fraud, incapable of selfless love,
            * That one had no talent or insight. 
 - Refuse to keep a diary because it might turn your quiet, reflective time into a sort of performance and self-deception for the sake of your (future) readers.
 - Engage with the world! (Do not fantasize too much about it.)

 > We flip up our jacket collar and consider briefly how cool we must look.  
 > We're fearless warriors on our way to the top.  
 > It's the opening credits montage.  
 > It's a scene in a novel.  
 > It feels good [...] and so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

### The danger of early pride

 > Whom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising.  
 > 
 > _(Cyril Connolly)_
 >
 > Are you going to be a fool?  
 > Are you going to let this money puff you up?  
 > Keep your eyes open.  
 > Don't lose your balance.  
 >
 > _(John D. Rockefeller)_

 - Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
 - What things make me feel too good?
 - Don't boast. There's nothing in it for you.
    + ...except inflating your own ego and later paying for it.

 > What we cultivate less is how to protect ourselves against the validation and gratification that will quickly come our way if we show promise.  
 > What we don't protect ourselves against are people and _things_ that make us feel good -- or rather, too good.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

### Work, work, work

 - Ignore whatever plaudits others are getting.
 - Ignore whatever plaudits _you_ are getting.
 - Work.

## Success

 - Ego weakens the mind that helped you succeed in the first place.

 > Success is intoxicating.  
 > To sustain it requires sobriety.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

### Don't tell yourself a story

 > If the players take care of the details, the score takes care of itself.
 >
 > _(Bill Walsh)_

 - Standards of performance (SoPs).
    + Not about control,
    + But about instilling excellence.
    + Seemingly trivial details:
        * Do not sit down on the practice field,
        * Do not browse the web for fun at work,
        * Maximum effort and commitment,
        * 8 hours of work per day minimum,
        * Office and room must be clean.

 > We want so desperately to believe that those who have great empires _set out_ to build one.  
 > Why?  
 > So we can indulge in the *pleasurable planning* of ours.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - Don't be thinking what your achievements say about you, or your failures.
    + Or else, you'll begin to slack off,
    + And to forget the SoPs that got you there.

 > Keep your identity small:
 > the more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.
 >
 > _(Paul Graham)_
 >
 > Make it about the work and the principles behind it.  
 > Not about a grand vision that makes a good headline.  
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - Don't confuse titles and praise with the real work that got you there.
 - Don't be thinking that success is now natural because your first big success kind of was.
 - Not everything is possible. 
    + Just try doing something and you'll see.
 - Maybe the lesson you should have extracted here is that whether you succeed (or fail), this does not mean you are special (or worthless).
 - Success is rooted in work.
    + And luck or grace.
    + And God only knows what else.
 - Don't build a narrative around who you were/are/will be.
 - Focus on the execution.
    + Execution is sacred,
    + And primal.

### What's important to you?

 - You accomplished so much (more than you ever expected to).
    + But it's not enough for you.
 - You want more, but you can't decide what's important for you.
 - You're never happy with what you have.
    + You want what others have too.
 + Ultimately, at the end of the day, you want more than everyone else.
    + Maybe then you'll feel satisfied.
    + But most likely, not.
    + What a chore.
    + How tiring.
 - You started knowing what's important to you:
    + Outdoing your previous self,
    + Contribution to others.
 - Once you achieved it though, you lost sight of your priorities.
 
 > An honest man who just couldn't help himself, who couldn't manage to focus, and ended up far outside the bounds of his ample genius.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - Fear of missing out (FOMO).
 - We just can't say "no."
    + Out of vague attraction, greed or vanity.

 > All of us waste precious life doing things we don't like, to prove ourselves to people we don't respect, and to get things we don't want.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - You keep going down this road of success and you'll keep meeting others more successful than you.
    + How will you react?
    + Will you feel insignificant?
 - A prescription:
    + Choose a competition,
    + Set standards of performance,
    + Work hard to get closer and closer to your potential,
    + The results will come as a byproduct.
        + Or not $$\Rightarrow$$ regroup!
    + Please don't choose _"I want to be better than, have more than, everyone, everywhere."_
 - Do not look at other people and make their approval your goal, ignoring your true potential and purpose.
 - **Definition (Euthymia)**: _A sense of your own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it._
 - Think about what's important to you and ignore the rest.
    + Why do you do what you do?
    + What are you after?

### Beware of the disease of me

 - Who has time to look at a picture of himself? What's the point?

### Meditate on the immensity

 > When we lack a connection to anything larger or bigger than us, it's like a piece of our soul is gone.  
 > We just can't forget which is bigger and which has been here longer.  
 > It's hard to be self-absorbed and convinced of your own greatness inside the solitude and quiet of a sensory deprivation tank.  
 > It's hard to be anything but humble walking alone along a beach late at night with an endless black ocean crashing loudly against the ground next to you.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - This is why you like nature: it reminds you of your place and how privileged you are to have it.
    + e.g., sitting in the grass at midnight starring at the Milky Way.
 - Meditation helps repeal the ego.

## Failure

 > Ego adds self-injury to every injury you experience.  
 > A fragile sense of self is constantly under threat.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - When things get difficult, ego betrays you and gets in the way.

 > [The great failing is] to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth.
 >
 > _(Goethe)_

 - Be humble and be strong.

### The effort is enough

 - Do the right thing (e.g., work) and worry not about what comes to pass.
 - You might face abject failure or pure indifference.
 - That's what happens when a project leaves your hand and goes in the hands of _other people._
 - How foolish to expect them to see things as you do.
 - How foolish to feel insulted or applauded by their reaction.
 - Doing good work is sufficient.
 - The effort is enough.

 > How do you take pride in yourself and your work?  
 > Change the definition of success.  
 > Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - Like Richard Feynman said, _"doing the work is the prize."_

 > How arbitrary (many of) the breaks in life are...
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - The world is indifferent to what you want or need.
 - If you persist in your desires, you are setting yourself up for resentment or worse.
 - Doing the work is enough.

### Draw the line

 - When you get your identity tied up in your work, you worry that any failure will say something bad about you as *a person*.
 - It's almost like you're afraid of admitting that you failed *as a normal fallible person*, not as the idealized grandiose personality your ego painted for you.
 - It's a sunk cost fallacy: I've already invested so much in this grandiosity of mine, am I supposed to stop despite all of the evidence around me that I'm not as great as I paint myself to be?
 - We are fallible.
    + It is said so in the bible,
    + And for good reason.

 > When a team looks like they're going to lose a game, the coach doesn't call them over and lie to them.
 > Instead, he or she reminds them who they are and what they're capable of, and urges them to _go back out there and embody that_.
 >
 > Only ego thinks embarrassment or failure are more than what they are.
 >
 > _(Ryan Holiday)_

 - Is this going to be a "lose-lose" situation or a "lose... and then win?"
 - Circle of life: aspire and then succeed or fail.  
 - Wisdom: success and failure are transitory and *not* a statement about your value as a human being.

### Maintain your own scorecard

 - Always hold yourself to a higher standard than what others might consider "good."
 - Care little about what other people think and more about if you met your own standards.
 - In the face of success, be careful:
    + Celebrate and accept congratulations,
    + But keep your head down and focus on getting _even better_.
 - **Measure yourself against your potential: the absolute best you are capable of.**
    + First of all, are you even meeting your standards of performance?
    + This way you won't seek the spotlight or other's applause as much.
    - Make meeting, exceeding and redifining your standards trump all of that.

### Always love

 > Why should we feel anger at the world?  
 > As if the world would notice?
 >
 > _(Euripedes)_

 - Take inventory: 
    + What do you dislike?
    + Whose name fills you with revulsion and rage?
 - Now ask:
    + Have these strong feelings really helped you accomplish anything?
    + **Where has hatred, anger or rage ever gotten anyone?**
 - Obsession with the past is ego embodied: 
    + You can't conceive of accepting that someone could hurt you, deliberately or otherwise,
    + So you hate.

 > It is the small things.  
 > Everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keeps the darkness at bay.  
 > Simple acts of kindness and love.
 >
 > _([Mithrandir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-8dFg0OSdE))_

### For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy...

 > I don't like work -- no man does -- but I like what is in the work -- the chance to find yourself.
 >
 > _(Joseph Conrad)_

 - Keeping your ego at bay is like keeping your house clean: every day you must sweep the floor or else the dust settles and accumulates.
 - Sweep the damn floor every minute of every day.
 - And then again.
