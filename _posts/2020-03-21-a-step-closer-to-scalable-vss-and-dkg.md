**tl;dr:** We apply a new proof precomputation technique by Feist and Khovratovich[^FK20] to further scale $(t,n)$ _Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)_ protocols to $\Theta(n\log{n})$ time sharing phase, $\Theta(n)$ dealer communication and $O(n)$ time share verification (during reconstruction phase).
\
\
This is an improvement over our [previous work][prevpost], which has a $\Theta(n\log{t})$ time sharing phase, $\Theta(n\log{t})$ dealer communication and $O(n\log{t})$ time share verification (during reconstruction).
These improvements carry over to _distributed key generation (DKG)_ protocols too.
Furthermore, these improvements are concrete too, not just asymptotic.

This post is a _continuation to our [previous post](https://alinush.github.io/2020/03/12/towards-scalable-vss-and-dkg.html)_ on scaling VSS and DKG protocols using _AMT proofs_.
Throughout this post, we'll refer to proofs computed using the Feist and Khovratovich[^FK20] technique as _FK proofs_.
Similarly, we'll refer to the resulting VSS and DKG protocols as _FK VSS_ and _FK DKG_, respectively.

<!-- TODO: link to n\log{n} branch -->
A prototype implementation of FK-based VSS and DKG benchmarks is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/alinush/libpolycrypto/).

## Preliminaries

Let $[n]=\\{1,2,3,\dots,n\\}$.
Let $p$ be a sufficiently large prime that denotes the order of our groups.

In this post, beyond basic group theory for cryptographers[^KL15] and basic polynomial arithmetic, I will assume you are familiar with a few concepts:

 - **Bilinear maps**[^GPS08]. Specifically, $\exists$ a bilinear map $e : \G_1 \times \G_2 \rightarrow \G_T$ such that:
    - $\forall u\in \G_1,v\in \G_2, a\in \Zp, b\in \Zp, e(u^a, v^b) = e(u,v)^{ab}$
    - $e(g_1,g_2)\ne 1_T$ where $g_1,g_2$ are the generators of $\G_1$ and $\G_2$ respectively and $1_T$ is the identity of $\G_T$
 - **KZG**[^KZG10a] **polynomial commitments** (see [previous post][prevpost]),
 - The **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**[^CLRS09] applied to polynomials. Specifically,
    - Suppose $\Zp$ admits a primitive _root of unity_ $\omega$ of order $n$ (i.e., $n \mid p-1$)
    - Let $$H=\{1, \omega, \omega^2, \omega^3, \dots, \omega^{n-1}\}$$ denote the set of all $n$ $n$th roots of unity
    - Then, FFT can be used to efficiently evaluate any polynomial $\phi(X)$ at all $X\in H$ in $\Theta(n\log{n})$ time
        - i.e., compute all $$\{\phi(\omega^{i-1})\}_{i\in[n]}$$
 - **$(t,n)$ Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)** via Shamir Secret Sharing, specifically _eVSS_[^KZG10a] (see [previous post][prevpost]),
 - **$(t,n)$ Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** via VSS (see [previous post][prevpost]).

### Faster VSS

![eVSS vs. AMT VSS vs. FK VSS in terms of dealing time](/pictures/fkvss-deal-times.png){: .align-center}

{: .info}
The $x$-axis is $\log_2(t)$ where $t$ is the threshold, which doubles for every tick.
They $y$-axis is the dealing time in seconds.
The graph shows that our AMT-based VSS outscales eVSS for large $t$ and performs better even at the scale of hundreds of players.

### Faster DKG

Since in a DKG protocol, each player performs a VSS with all the other players, the results from above carry over to DKG protocols too.
In fact, the DKG dealing time (per-player) doesn't differ much from the VSS dealing time, especially as $t$ gets large.
Thus, the improvement in DKG dealing times is perfectly illustrated by the graph above too.

## Remaining questions

Our $(t,n)$ VSS/DKG protocols require $t$-SDH public parameters.
Thus, the non-trivial problem of generating $t$-SDH public parameters remains.
In some sense, we make this problem worse because our scalable protocols require a large $t$.
We hope to address this in future work.
