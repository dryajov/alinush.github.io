<!-- TODO:

Interesting subtleties to cover:

1. singatures are zkpoks of a secret key or not?

2. Simulation for deniable authentication should be 'straight line' (no rewinding allowed for some reason) according to Gennaro's presentation.
See:
 
 - Pass's paper on why: https://iacr.org/archive/crypto2003/27290315/27290315.pdf
 - https://www.dmi.unict.it/diraimondo/web/wp-content/uploads/papers/deniability-ake.pdf

3. NIZK versus interactive ZK: both have simulators, no? But NIZK guarantees are  weaker since you can send proof to others and convince them. How is the simulation different?
