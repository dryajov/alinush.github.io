This is a summary of ["The Courage to be Disliked"](https://amzn.to/2QRoDjU), by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga.
The book also has a sequel called ["The Courage to be Happy"](https://amzn.to/2WQX3Xt) (by the same authors), but we'll cover it in another post.
(Support this article by buying the books using the links above.)

_"The Courage to be Disliked"_ explains the power of Adlerian psychology.
The book is written as a down-to-earth dialogue between a young _student_ and an older _philosopher_, much like [Plato's dialogues](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/index.htm).
At times, the dialogue seems forced or unnatural but, if you get past that, I think the book has a lot of fascinating ideas.

For now, I'll start listing a bunch of ideas from each chapter in the book.
All I'm going to do is write the ideas in bullet-point form and summarize the point (I think) the author is trying to make.
Later, I'll organize them into something more coherent.

Note: We'll use A, P and Y to denote the philosopher, the youth and Adler, respectively.

## Introduction

 - The world is simple.
 - Life is simple
    - Despite the innocence of children vanishing as they mature,
    - ...as they notice discrimination, war and inequality.
    - Religion used to keep life simple, but people stopped believing,
    - ...and anxiety took its place.
    - Yet, the philosopher maintains his view: the world & life are simple.
 - We live in a subjective world that we each give meaning to. Not an objective one.
     - "At present the world seems complicated and mysterious to you, but if you change the world will appear more simple. The issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are."
 - "Can you look directly at the world? Do you have the **courage**?"
    - Not with "dark" glasses where you only see the gloomy parts of life.
    - Not with "bright" glasses either.
 - In other words, can you **change**?
 - People can change. 
 - They can also find happiness.
 - Everyone, without exception.

### Summary

**Concepts:** _courage_, _change_

The author lays out his thesis:

 - The world and life are simple.
 - To see this, you need to have the courage to change: to look directly at the world, without any "dark" or "bright" glasses, which might make it seem a certain way.
 - Anybody can change.
    + Not just in this regard, but in many others.
 - Anybody can find happiness.

## Deny trauma (The first night)

### [Alfred Adler:] The unknown "third giant"

 - The unknown third giant of psychology is Alfred Adler, right next to Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud
    - One of the original core members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, led by Freud
    - He didn't agree with Freud and proposed his own original, **individual psychology**
 - His psychology/philosophy is called **Adlerian psychology**
    - "Rather than being a strict area of scholarship, Adlerian psychology is accepted as realisation; a culmination of truths and of human understanding"
    - **TODO:** more clarification needed on whether Adler was a philosopher or psychologist or both
        - Youth: "Are you a philosopher? Or [...] a psychologist?"
        - Philosopher: "I am a philosopher [...]. Adlerian psychology is a form of thought that is in line with Greek philosophy and [thus] that _is_ philosophy."

### Why people can change

 - Youth argues people can't change because he has a friend who stays at home, even though he could be of great use to society.
 - Youth likens this to a neurosis or panic: his friend wants to change, but he can't.
 - Youth attributes this to:
    - relationship with parents
    - bullying
    - trauma
    - too much pampering as a child
    - hard to know; insufficient info about his past and family situation
 - Philosopher summarizes youth's point with "Who I am now (the effect) is determined by occurrences in the past (the causes)"
 - But if this were the case, every abused child would suffer the same damned fate, which leads to a kind of determinism.
 - Yet, observing the world, we see that's not the case: many people recover from their past circumstances.
 - Adlerian psychology takes a firm standpoint: _The past doesn't matter._
 - This raises the point, if the past doesn't matter, then how to explain the reclusiveness of the friend?
 - The answer is to look at the _goals_ rather than _past_.
 - We'd like to think "I am anxious so I can't go out."
 - But in reality "My goal is to not go out, so I am creating a state of anxiety."
 - This is called **teleology**: the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause.
    - For example, the reason you procrastinate might be because your goal is to never find out how good you are at something; your upper limits.
 - It's the opposite of **aetiology**: the study of causation

### Trauma does not exist

 - Adler says: 
    - "We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences -- the so-called trauma -- but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes."
    - "We are not determined by our experiences, but [by] the meaning we give them."
 - Horrible calamities influence our personality, but they do not determine anything.
 - "We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give [...] past experiences."
 - Another explanation for reclusiveness: "I want the attention of my parents, so I can feel special. So I'll sit inside all the time so they will worry about me and treat me with extreme care. If I go out, I'll just be another one in the crowd, average, without special care from anyone."

### People fabricate anger

 - Example: waiter spilled coffee on youth, he got angry and then started yelling at waiter.
 - He couldn't "help himself." It was the anger.
 - Teleology flips this around: The youth manufactured the emotion of anger (i.e., the phenomenon) so that he could yell at the waiter (i.e., his goal) 
    + Perhaps because yelling is the simple way to get the waiter to submit to you fast. So the final goal might've really been to get the waiter to fix the problem fast.
 - Teleology is confirmed by situations like this: you're angry at your daughter, yelling at her, but the phone is ringing, so you have to pick up. Because it's somebody else, your tone of voice immediately changes. You are calm. When the conversation is over, you return to your angry mood, whose purpose presumably is to get your daughter to submit to you.
    + So anger is a tool that can be pulled out as needed and put away when not needed.

### How to live without being controlled by the past

 - Youth accuses philosopher of nihilism, of denying human emotions, like anger.
 - Philosopher's only argument is that people _can_ resist their emotions. That they are not completely controlled by them.
    + In fact, for some emotions like anger, we seem to be the ones controlling them. 
 - In addition, Adlerian psychology also argues that people are not controlled by the past.
 - Example: what matters is not your parent's divorce, but the meaning you give to it.
 - In contrast, Frediuan aetiology (kind of) "denies free will and treats humans like machines."
 - "People are not driven by past causes, but move toward goals that they themselves set."

### Socrates and Adler

 - If everybody can change, then youth wants to change to be like his super-outgoing, super-likeable friend. Can he?
 - Philosopher says it's totally out of the question: the first step to change is _knowing_.
 - Youth assumes if he learns about Adlerian psychology he can become like his friend.
 - Philosopher cautions him against rushing for answers.
 - Gives Socrates (and Adler) as an example.
 - Socrates left no book written by himself but had public debates with many people.
 - Adler was similar, having many discussions at Cafes in Vienna.
 - Philosopher says youth's doubts will be dispelled via this kind of dialogue/debate.

### Are you okay just as you are?

 - P: the reason you want to be like your super-outgoing friend is because you think you will be happier that way.
    + Because you don't love yourself.
 - "If you were to ask around for people who say they like themselves, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who'd puff up their chest with pride and say, 'Yes, I like myself.'" 
 - Y, turning this against the philosopher: But do you like yourself?
 - P: At the very least I accept who I am.
 - P: But this does not mean "it's fine to be 'just as you are'"
 - P: Your unhappiness means you must change. Put one foot in front of the other and do it.
 - A: "The important thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that equipment." 
 - P: You are focused on what you're born with, and want to be born as your super-outgoing friend.
 - P: Instead, focus on what you can do with what you were born with.

### Summary

**Concepts:** _Adlerian psychology_, _individual psychology_, _trauma_, _teleology_, _aetiology_

The past doesn't matter.
Look at people's goals, rather than the past to explain their (mis)behaviour.
Look at the purpose of a phenomenon, rather than its cause.
For example, "I don't want to go out because people might laugh at me, so I am creating a state of anxiety."
For example, "I want you to submit to me fast, so I'll create a state of anger."
For example, "I want my parent's complete attention and care, so I'll stay inside all the time so they can worry about my reclusiveness."

Trauma does not exist.
Our past experiences can influence our personality, but do not determine anything.
We determine everything by the meaning we ascribe to our experiences.
(i.e., "We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences -- the so-called trauma -- but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes.")
