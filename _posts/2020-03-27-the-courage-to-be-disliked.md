This is a summary of ["The Courage to be Disliked"](https://amzn.to/2QRoDjU), by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga.
This book also has a sequel called ["The Courage to be Happy"](https://amzn.to/2WQX3Xt) (by the same authors), but we'll discuss that in a next post.
(Support this article by buying the books using the links above.)

"The Courage to be Disliked" is about the power of Adlerian psychology.
It is written as a down-to-earth dialogue between a young student and an older philosopher, much like [Plato's dialogues](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/index.htm).
At times, the dialogue seems forced or unnatural but, if you get past that, I think the book has a lot of fascinating ideas.

For now, I'll start listing a bunch of ideas from the book and later I'll organize them into something more coherent.

## Introduction

 - The world is simple.
 - Life is simple
    - Despite the innocence of children vanishing as they mature,
    - ...as they notice discrimination, war and inequality.
    - Religion used to keep life simple, but people stopped believing,
    - ...and anxiety took its place.
    - Yet, the philosopher maintains his view: the world & life are simple.
 - We live in a subjective world that we each give meaning to. Not an objective one.
     - "At present the world seems complicated and mysterious to you, but if you change the world will appear more simple. The issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are."
 - "Can you look directly at the world? Do you have the **courage**?"
    - Not with "dark" glasses where you only see the gloomy parts of life.
    - Not with "bright" glasses either.
 - In other words, can you **change**?
 - People can change. 
 - They can also find happiness.
 - Everyone, without exception.

### Summary

**Concepts:** _courage_, _change_

The world and life are simple.
You need to have the courage to change: to look directly at the world, without any "dark" or "bright" glasses, which might make it seem a certain way.
Anybody can change.
Not just in this regard, but in many others.
Anybody can find happiness.

## Deny trauma (The first night)

### [Alfred Adler:] The unknown "third giant"

 - The unknown third giant of psychology is Alfred Adler, right next to Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud
    - One of the original core members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, led by Freud
    - He didn't agree with Freud and proposed his own original, **individual psychology**
 - His psychology/philosophy is called **Adlerian psychology**
    - "Rather than being a strict area of scholarship, Adlerian psychology is accepted as realisation; a culmination of truths and of human understanding"
    - **TODO:** more clarification needed on whether Adler was a philosopher or psychologist or both
        - Youth: "Are you a philosopher? Or [...] a psychologist?"
        - Philosopher: "I am a philosopher [...]. Adlerian psychology is a form of thought that is in line with Greek philosophy and [thus] that _is_ philosophy."

### Why people can change

 - Youth argues people can't change because he has a friend who stays at home, even though he could be of great use to society.
 - Youth likens this to a neurosis or panic: his friend wants to change, but he can't.
 - Youth attributes this to:
    - relationship with parents
    - bullying
    - trauma
    - too much pampering as a child
    - hard to know; insufficient info about his past and family situation
 - Philosopher summarizes youth's point with "Who I am now (the effect) is determined by occurrences in the past (the causes)"
 - But if this were the case, every abused child would suffer the same damned fate, which leads to a kind of determinism.
 - Yet, observing the world, we see that's not the case: many people recover from their past circumstances.
 - Adlerian psychology takes a firm standpoint: _The past doesn't matter._
 - This raises the point, if the past doesn't matter, then how to explain the reclusiveness of the friend?
 - The answer is to look at the _goals_ rather than _past_.
 - We'd like to think "I am anxious so I can't go out."
 - But in reality "My goal is to not go out, so I am creating a state of anxiety."
 - This is called **teleology**: the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause.
 - It's the opposite of **aetiology**: the study of causation

### Trauma does not exist

 - Adler says: 
    - "We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences -- the so-called trauma -- but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes."
    - "We are not determined by our experiences, but [by] the meaning we give them."
 - Horrible calamities influence our personality, but they do not determine anything.
 - "We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give [...] past experiences."

### Summary

**Concepts:** _Adlerian psychology_, _individual psychology_, _trauma_, _teleology_, _aetiology_

The past doesn't matter.
Look at people's goals, rather than the past to explain their (mis)behaviour.
Look at the purpose of a phenomenon, rather than its cause.
For example, "I don't want to go out because people might laugh at me, so I am creating a state of anxiety."
